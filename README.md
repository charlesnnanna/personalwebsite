## General info
Add more general information about project. What the purpose of the project is? Motivation?
I have seen multiple awesome portfolio websites. They are all nice but they all seem to be lacking one thing or the other. Problems I've encountered when navigating through a portfolio website inclutes:
* Epic load times - It takes like forever to load a page. This might be because of too many complex(and beautiful) designs. 
* Bad and ugly designs - Some developers are OK with this because they feel that portfolio website don't need much designs or it might be the fear of Forever Load times. they put little or no effort at all in the sites design. Truly a portfolio don't need much design but at the least it should have a good and attractive design without sacrificing quick load times.
* Lack of content required to market the individual well - This is not really an issue a web developer can tackle, but it is one of the major issues portfolios have today. 
* No chatbot to engage with potential employers
The essence therefore of this project is to tackle all these mninor issues we see on portfolio websites today. The idea here is to create an awwesome web developer portfolio website that would immediately clear all the doubts of a potential employer.
